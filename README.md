# Foundation for Emails Template (v2)

**Please open all issues regarding the framework on the main [Foundation for Emails](http://github.com/zurb/foundation-emails/issues) repo.**

This is the modified starter project for [Foundation for Emails](http://foundation.zurb.com/emails), a framework for creating responsive HTML devices that work in any email client. It has a Gulp-powered build system with these features:

 - Handlebars HTML templates
 - Simplified HTML email syntax
 - Sass compilation
 - Image compression
 - Built-in BrowserSync server
 - Full email inlining process
 - Automated litmus testing
 - Full email minimization
 - Send manual email tests
 - Deploy images to hosted server
 - Zip emails by HTML and images



## Installation
To use this template, your computer needs to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 0.12 or greater.

### Setup
To set up the template, run the following command:

```bash
cd projectname
npm i
```



## Build Commands

Run `npm start` to kick off the build process. A new browser tab will open with a server pointing to your project files.

Run `npm run build` to inline your CSS into your HTML along with the rest of the build process.

Run `npm run litmus` to build as above, then submit to litmus for testing. *Litmus credentials are required (config/config.json)*

Run `npm run mail` to build as above, then send to specified email address for testing. *SMTP server details required (config/config.json)*

Run `npm run zip` to build as above, then zip HTML and images for easy deployment to email marketing services.

Run `npm run deploy` to build as above, then FTP's HTML and images to hosted server. *Server details (config/config.json) and image path required (config/paths.json)*

Run `npm run framework` to install the latest version of foundation-for-emails 2 framework using bower.



## Configuration

### Browser-sync (config.json)
When running browser-sync, by default it will use port `3000`. To change to a new port, you can either replace the configured in the `config/config.json` file or added as a parameter like so: `npm run start -- --port="3000"`.

#### Config.json
```json
{
  "PORT" : "3000"
}
```

### Deploy (config.json + paths.json)
Running deploy will FTP all generated HTML and images to our specified hosted server in `config/paths.json`. The FTP credentials can be configured in the `config/config.json` file.

#### Config.json
```json
{
  "FTP" : {
      "host" : "YOUR_HOSTED_SERVER",
      "user" : "YOUR_USERNAME",
      "password" : "YOUR_PASSWORD",
      "parallel" : 10
  }
}
```

#### Paths.json
```json
{
  "ftp" : {
      "base" : "HTTPS://WWW.DOMAIN.COM/",
      "src" : "CLIENT/EMAILS/",
      "image" : "ASSETS/IMG"
  }
}
```


### Litmus Tests (config.json)

Testing in Litmus requires the images to be hosted publicly. The provided gulp task handles this by automating hosting to our ftp server configured in `config/config.json` and `config/paths.json`. Provide your Litmus account details to `config/config.json`. *Litmus config is a requirement!*

#### Config.json
```json
{
  "LITMUS": {
    "username": "YOUR_LITMUS@EMAIL.com",
    "password": "YOUR_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD",
    "url": "https://YOUR_ACCOUNT.litmus.com",
    "applications": ["ol2003","ol2007","ol2010","ol2011","ol2013","chromegmailnew","chromeyahoo","appmail9","iphone5s","ipad","android4","androidgmailapp"]
  }
}
```

For a full list of Litmus' supported test clients(applications) see their [client list](https://litmus.com/emails/clients.xml).


### Manual email test (config.json)

Similar to the Litmus tests, you can have each email sent to a specified email address. Just like with the Litmus tests, you will need to specify details of an SMTP server. The recipient email address can either be configured in the `config/config.json` file or added as a parameter like so: `npm run mail -- --to="example.com"`

```json
{
  "MAIL" : {
    "to": [
      "RECIPEINT_EMAIL@DOMAIN.COM"
    ],
    "from": "COMPANY_NAME <INFO@COMPANY.COM",
    "smtp": {
     "auth": {
       "user": "EMAIL@DOMAIN.COM",
       "pass": "YOUR_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD"
     },
      "host": "SMTP.DOMAIN.COM",
      "secureConnection": true,
      "port": 465
    }
  }
}
```
**NOTE:** For this task to work you'll need to have an SMTP account and provide the necessary credentials.


## Framework
Foundation for Emails (previously known as Ink) is a framework for creating responsive HTML emails that work in any email client â€” even Outlook. Our HTML/CSS components have been tested across every major email client to ensure consistency. And with the Inky templating language, writing HTML emails is now even easier.
